Have your waybars and fuzzels ready: niri is not a complete desktop environment.</p> <p>Here are some points you may have questions about:</p> <ul> <li>Multi-monitor: yes, a core part of the design from the very start. Mixed DPI works.</li> <li>Fractional scaling: yes, plus all niri UI stays pixel-perfect.</li> <li>NVIDIA: seems to work fine.</li> <li>Floating windows: yes, starting from niri 25.01.</li> <li>Input devices: niri supports tablets, touchpads, and touchscreens. You can map the tablet to a specific monitor, or use OpenTabletDriver. We have touchpad gestures, but no touchscreen gestures yet.</li> <li>Wlr protocols: yes, we have most of the important ones like layer-shell, gamma-control, screencopy. You can check on wayland.app at the bottom of each protocol's page.</li> <li>Performance: while I run niri on beefy machines, I try to stay conscious of performance. I've seen someone use it fine on an Eee\u00a0PC\u00a0900 from\u00a02008, of all things.</li> <li>Xwayland: no built-in support, but xwayland-satellite is easy to set up and works very well.<ul> <li>Steam and games, including Proton: work perfectly through xwayland-satellite.</li> <li>JetBrains IDEs, Ghidra: work well through xwayland-satellite.</li> <li>Discord and other Electron apps: work well through xwayland-satellite.</li> <li>Chromium and VSCode: work perfectly natively on Wayland with the right flags.</li> <li>X11 apps that want to position windows or bars at specific screen coordinates: won't work well; you can run them in a nested compositor like labwc or rootful Xwayland.</li> <li>Display scaling (integer or fractional) keeps X11 apps crisp, but you need the latest xwayland-satellite.

Other game launchers such as Lutris have their own ways of setting gamescope options.</p> <p>Running X11-based games with this method doesn't require Xwayland as gamescope creates its own Xwayland server.

Open it from a terminal and press the key that you want to detect. In the terminal, you will see output like this: <pre><code>[14:     wl_keyboard] key: serial: 757775; time: 44940343; key: 113; state: 1 (pressed)\n                    sym: Left         (65361), utf8: ''\n[14:     wl_keyboard] key: serial: 757776; time: 44940432; key: 113; state: 0 (released)\n                    sym: Left         (65361), utf8: ''\n[14:     wl_keyboard] key: serial: 757777; time: 44940753; key: 114; state: 1 (pressed)\n                    sym: Right        (65363), utf8: ''\n[14:     wl_keyboard] key: serial: 757778; time: 44940846; key: 114; state: 0 (released)\n                    sym: Right        (65363), utf8: ''\n</code></pre> Here, look at <code>sym: Left</code> and <code>sym: Right</code>: these are the key names. I was pressing the left and the right arrow in this example. Keep in mind that binding shifted keys requires spelling out Shift and the unshifted version of the key, according to your XKB layout. For example, on the US QWERTY layout, &lt; is on Shift + ,, so to bind it, you spell out something like <code>Mod+Shift+Comma</code>. As another example, if you've configured the French B\u00c9PO XKB layout, your &lt; is on AltGr + \u00ab. AltGr is <code>ISO_Level3_Shift</code>, or equivalently <code>Mod5</code>, so to bind it, you spell out something like <code>Mod+Mod5+guillemotleft</code>. When resolving latin keys, niri will search for the first configured XKB layout that has the latin key. So for example with US QWERTY and RU layouts configured, US QWERTY will be used for latin binds.</p> <p><sup>Since: 0.1.8</sup> Binds will repeat by default (i.e. holding down a bind will make it trigger repeatedly).

Is it really that... time again?</p> <p>A compositor deals with one or more monitors on mostly fixed refresh cycles. For example, a 170 Hz monitor can draw a frame every ~5.88 ms.</p> <p>Most of the time, the compositor doesn't actually redraw the monitor: when nothing changes on screen (e.g. you're reading a document and aren't moving your cursor), it would be wasteful to wake up the GPU to composite the same image. During an animation however, screen contents do change every frame. Niri will generally start drawing the next frame as soon as the previous one shows up on screen.</p> <p>Since the monitor refresh cycle is fixed in most cases (even with VRR, there's a maximum refresh rate), the compositor can predict when the next frame will show up on the monitor, and render ongoing animations for that exact moment in time. This way, all animation frames are perfectly timed with no jitter, regardless of when exactly the rendering code had a chance to run. For example, even if the compositor has to process new window events, delaying the rendering by a few ms, the animation timing will remain exactly aligned to the monitor refresh cycle.</p> <p>There are hence several properties that a compositor wants from its timing system.</p> <ol> <li>It should be possible to get the state of the animations at a specific time in the near future, for rendering a frame exactly timed to when the monitor will show it.<ul> <li>This time override ability should be usable in tests to advance the time in a fully controlled fashion.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Animations in response to user actions should begin at the moment when the action happens.    For example, pressing a workspace switch key should start the animation at the instant when the user pressed the key (rather than, say, slightly in the future where we predicted the next monitor frame, which we had already rendered by now).</li> <li>During the processing of a single action, querying the current time should return the exact same value.    Even if the processing finishes a few microseconds after it started, querying the time in the end should return the same thing.    This generally makes writing code much more sane; otherwise you'd need to for example avoid reading the position of some element twice in a row, since it could have moved by one pixel in-between, screwing with the logic.    Also, fetching the current system time can be quite expensive in terms of overhead.</li> <li>It should be reasonably easy to implement an animation slow-down preference, so all animations can be slowed down or sped up by the same factor.</li> </ol> <p>The solution in niri is a <code>LazyClock</code>, a clock that remembers one timestamp. Initially, the timestamp is empty, so when you ask <code>LazyClock</code> for the current time, it will fetch and return the system time, and also remember it. Subsequently, it will keep returning the same timestamp that it had remembered.</p> <p>You can also clear the timestamp, then <code>LazyClock</code> will fetch the system time anew when it's needed. In niri, the timestamp is cleared at the end of every event loop iteration, right before going to sleep waiting for new events. This way, anything that happens next (like a user key press) will fetch and use the most up-to-date timestamp as soon as one is needed, but then the processing code will keep getting the exact same timestamp, since <code>LazyClock</code> stores it.</p> <p>You can also just manually set the timestamp to a specific value. This is how we render a frame for the predicted time of when the monitor will show it. Also, this is used by tests: they simply always set the timestamp and never use the system time.</p> <p>Finally, there's an <code>AdjustableClock</code> wrapper on top that provides the ability to control the slow-down rate by modifying the timestamps returned by the clock.</p> <p>An important detail is that with rate changes, timestamps from the <code>AdjustableClock</code> will drift away and become unrelated to the system time. However, our target timestamp (for rendering) comes from the system time, so the override works directly on the underlying <code>LazyClock</code>. That is, overriding the timestamp and then querying the <code>AdjustableClock</code> will return a different timestamp that is correct and consistent with the adjustments made by <code>AdjustableClock</code>.

They can be sidestepped in specific circumstances if there's a good reason.</p> <ol> <li>Opening a new window should not affect the sizes of any existing windows.</li> <li>The focused window should not move around on its own.<ul> <li>In particular: windows opening, closing, and resizing to the left of the focused window should not cause it to visually move.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Actions should apply immediately.<ul> <li>Things like resizing or consuming into column take effect immediately, even if the window needs time to catch up.</li> <li>This is important both for compositor responsiveness and predictability, and for keeping the code sane and free of edge cases and unnecessary asynchrony.</li> </ul> </li> <li>If a window or popup is larger than the screen, it should be aligned in the top left corner.<ul> <li>The top left area of a window is more likely to contain something important, so it should always be visible.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Setting window width or height to a fixed pixel size (e.g. <code>set-column-width 1280</code> or <code>default-column-width { fixed 1280; }</code>) will set the size of the window itself, however setting to a proportional size (e.g. <code>set-column-width 50%</code>) will set the size of the tile, including the border added by niri.<ul> <li>With proportions, the user is looking to tile multiple windows on the screen, so they should include borders.</li> <li>With fixed sizes, the user wants to test a specific client size or take a specifically sized screenshot, so they should affect the window directly.</li> <li>After the size is set, it is always converted to a value that includes the borders, to make the code sane. That is, <code>set-column-width 1000</code> followed by changing the niri border width will resize the window accordingly.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>And here are some more principles I try to follow throughout niri.</p> <ol> <li>When disabled, eye-candy features should not affect the performance.<ul> <li>Things like animations and custom shaders do not run and are not present in the render tree when disabled. Extra offscreen rendering is avoided.</li> <li>Animations specifically are still \"started\" even when disabled, but with a duration of 0 (this way, they end as soon as the time is advanced). This does not impact performance, but helps avoid a lot of edge cases in the code.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Eye-candy features should not cause unreasonable excessive rendering.<ul> <li>For example, clip-to-geometry will prevent direct scanout in many cases (since the window surface is not completely visible). But in the cases where the surface or the subsurface is completely visible (fully within the clipped region), it will still allow for direct scanout.</li> <li>For example, animations can cause damage and even draw to an offscreen every frame, because they are expected to be short (and can be disabled). However, something like the rounded corners shader should not offscreen or cause excessive damage every frame, because it is long-running and constantly active.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Be mindful of invisible state.</p> <p>This is niri state that is not immediately apparent from looking at the screen. This is not bad per se, but you should carefully consider how to reduce the surprise factor.</p> <ul> <li>For example, when a monitor disconnects, all its workspaces move to another connected monitor. In order to be able to restore these workspaces when the first monitor connects again, these workspaces keep the knowledge of which was their original monitor\u2014this is an example of invisible state, since you can't tell it in any way by looking at the screen. This can have surprising consequences: imagine disconnecting a monitor at home, going to work, completely rearranging the windows there, then coming back home, and suddenly some random workspaces end up on your home monitor. In order to reduce this surprise factor, whenever a new window appears on a workspace, that workspace resets its original monitor to its current monitor. This way, the workspaces you actively worked on remain where they were.</li> <li>For example, niri preserves the view position whenever a window appears, or whenever a window goes full-screen, to restore it afterward. This way, dealing with temporary things like dialogs opening and closing, or toggling full-screen, becomes less annoying, since it doesn't mess up the view position. This is also invisible state, as you cannot tell by looking at the screen where closing a window will restore the view position. If taken to the extreme (previous view position saved forever for every open window), this can be surprising, as closing long-running windows would result in the view shifting around pretty much randomly. To reduce this surprise factor, niri remembers only one last view position per workspace, and forgets this stored view position upon window focus change.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Development-Developing-niri/","title":"Developing niri","text":""},{"location":"Development-Developing-niri/#running-a-local-build","title":"Running a Local Build","text":"<p>The main way of testing niri during development is running it as a nested window.

Wayland clients mostly work in the logical space, and it's the most convenient space to do all the layout in, since it bakes in the output scaling factor.</p> <p>However, many things need to be sized or positioned at integer physical coordinates. For example, Wayland toplevel buffers are assumed to be placed at an integer physical pixel on an output (and <code>WaylandSurfaceRenderElement</code> will do that for you). Borders and focus rings should also have a width equal to an integer number of physical pixels to stay crisp (not to mention that <code>SolidColorRenderElement</code> does not anti-alias lines at fractional pixel positions).</p> <p>Integer physical coordinates do not necessarily correspond to integer logical coordinates though. Even with an integer scale = 2, a physical pixel at (1, 1) will be at the logical position of (0.5, 0.5). This problem becomes much worse with fractional scale factors where most integer logical coordinates will fall on fractional physical coordinates.</p> <p>Thus, niri uses fractional logical coordinates for most of its layout. However, one needs to be very careful to keep things aligned to the physical grid to avoid artifacts like:</p> <ul> <li>Border width alternating 1 px thicker/thinner</li> <li>Border showing 1 px off from the window at certain positions</li> <li>1 px gaps around rounded corners</li> <li>Slightly blurry window contents during resizes</li> <li>And so on...</li> </ul> <p>The way it's handled in niri is:</p> <ol> <li> <p>All relevant sizes on a workspace are rounded to an integer physical coordinate according to the current output scale. Things like struts, gaps, border widths, working area location.</p> <p>It's important to understand that they remain fractional numbers in the logical space, but these numbers correspond to an integer number of pixels in the physical space. The rounding looks something like: <code>(logical_size * scale).round() / scale</code>. Whenever a workspace moves to an output with a different scale (or the output scale changes), all sizes are re-rounded from their original configured values to align with the new physical space. 2. The view offset and individual column/tile render offsets are not rounded to physical pixels, but: 3. <code>tiles_with_render_positions()</code> rounds tile positions to physical pixels as it returns them, 4. Custom shaders like opening, closing and resizing windows, are also careful to keep positions and sizes rounded to the physical pixels.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The idea is that every tile can assume that it is rendered at an integer physical coordinate, therefore when shifting the position by, say, border width (also rounded to integer physical coordinates), the new position will stay rounded to integer physical coordinates. The same logic works for the rest of the layout thanks to gaps, struts and working area being similarly rounded. This way, the entire layout is always aligned, as long as it is positioned at an integer physical coordinate (which rounding the tile positions effectively achieves).</p>"},{"location":"Development-Redraw-Loop/","title":"Redraw Loop","text":"<p>On a TTY, only one frame can be submitted to an output at a time, and the compositor must wait until the output repaints (indicated by a VBlank) to be able to submit the next frame.

Any operation that may cause the screen to update calls <code>queue_redraw()</code>, which moves the output to a <code>Queued</code> state.

Instead, we set a timer to fire roughly at when the next VBlank would occur, and transition to a <code>WaitingForEstimatedVBlank</code> state.</p> <p>This is necessary in order to throttle frame callbacks sent to applications to at most once per output refresh cycle.

So, <code>focus-workspace 2</code> will always put you on the second workspace of the monitor, whichever workspace that currently is.</p> <p>This is an important distinction from WMs with static workspace systems. In niri, workspaces do not have indices on their own. If you take the first workspace and move it further down on the monitor, <code>focus-workspace 1</code> will now put you on a different workspace (the one that was below the first workspace before you moved it).</p> <p>When you want to have a more permanent workspace in niri, you can create a named workspace in the config or via the <code>set-workspace-name</code> action.

This can work to some extent, but it can become somewhat confusing, since you can still move these workspaces up and down and between monitors. If you're coming from a static workspace WM, I suggest not doing that, but instead trying the \"niri way\" with dynamic workspaces, focusing and moving up/down instead of by index.
